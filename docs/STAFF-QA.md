# Staff feature verification — 2026-09-04

The shared admin dashboard was visually inspected in Design Studio and its mobile frame measured 375px content width / 375px scroll width. Public verification loaded the existing barangay identity, original ID-number-plus-last-name form, camera-off default, and saved-QR input.

Automated tests cover actual form submit handlers, error retention, safe table/result rendering, cover max-five validation and protected namespace saves, role/permission checks on guarded modules, temporary-grant expiry, separate activity scopes and Manila-calendar ranges, privacy-safe public metric keys, original ID expiry rules, production QR URL construction, and decoding a generated QR with an independent decoder.

The live project was inspected read-only to confirm the delegated-permission, staff-activity, public-metric, deletion-audit, protected RPC, trigger, RLS, and Storage-policy contracts already exist. The database timezone remains UTC; activity reporting converts boundaries to the barangay's Asia/Manila calendar, and the public verification result still trusts the original RPC's returned status. No live account, grant, activity row, content record, token, file, or setting was changed by these checks.

Not exercised against production: authenticated save/delete/upload, permission granting, activity deletion, invitation/approval emails, actual camera hardware scanning, and printing a physical QR. These actions require the user's normal staff session, explicit confirmation, or hardware and were not simulated as production successes. Billing, plan quotas, database disk size and bandwidth are not connected, and are explicitly labeled unavailable rather than zero.
